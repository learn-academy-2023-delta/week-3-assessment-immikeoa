# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes, allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and reusable code.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability, often used for web development and scripting. It emphasizes elegant and expressive syntax, supporting object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming paradigms.

3. Implicit return: is a feature in some programming languages where a function automatically returns the result of the last expression evaluated without explicitly using the return keyword.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are a way to group and encapsulate code to be executed later, often used for iterators or defining custom behavior within methods.

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are key-value data structures that allow you to store and retrieve values based on unique keys, similar to dictionaries in other programming languages.
